## Arrays

Arrays are data structures that hold a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable and are a fundamental part of many algorithms.

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text. String manipulation problems often involve operations like searching, sorting, and modifying strings.

## Stacks

Stacks are abstract data types that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. They are used in various applications, including expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and more.

## Linked Lists

Linked Lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

## Dequeue and Queue

Queues are abstract data types that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Dequeues (double-ended queues) allow insertion and deletion from both ends. They are used in scenarios like task scheduling and buffering.

## Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive algorithms are often elegant and can simplify the process of solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
