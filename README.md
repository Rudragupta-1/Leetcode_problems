Arrays
Arrays are data structures that hold a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable and are a fundamental part of many algorithms.

Strings
Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text. String manipulation problems often involve operations like searching, sorting, and modifying strings.

Stacks
Stacks are abstract data types that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. They are used in various applications, including expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and more.

Linked Lists
Linked Lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

Dequeue and Queue
Queues are abstract data types that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Dequeues (double-ended queues) allow insertion and deletion from both ends. They are used in scenarios like task scheduling and buffering.

Recursion
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive algorithms are often elegant and can simplify the process of solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
